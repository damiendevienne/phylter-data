## Simulated datasets used for the Phylter article

Functions in file `code.R` allow simulating the datasests generated for evaluation of Phylter and comparison with TreeShrink. 
It also contains the scripts used for producing the figures. 
Functions in code.R call functions that are present in the ../functions.R file (parent folder).

The datasets themselves, obtained with functions in `code.R` and used for the publication, are present as four files, named `RESULTS-NEWSIMUL-SP-*.tab`. Each one of the file corresponds to a different level of ILS, controled by the size of the simulated populations (SP in program SimPhy).
