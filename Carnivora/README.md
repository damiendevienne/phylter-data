# Data and code for the Carnivora analyses

The file `code.R` contains all the code to reproduce the analyses and the figures for the Carnivora analysis, except for the synteny analysis for which scripts and datasets are in folder `synteny`.

The file `code.R` uses as input: 
- The results of the PhylteR analyses available in `data/phylter-results/`
- The results of the Duplication score analysis available in `data/duplications-and-info/` (along with an explanation of its computation)
- The file `Supermatrix_14463_genes_53_spp_UFBS_TESTNEW_Codon.tre` containing the full Carnivora species tree used in our analyses. 


The gene trees (in tar folder `data/trees.tar.xz`) and the alignments (in tar folder `data/alignments.tar.xz`) used for running PhylteR and TreeShrink are avialble.
