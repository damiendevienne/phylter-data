# Data and code for the Carnivora analyses

Here are the gene trees (in tar folder `data/trees.tar.xz`), the alignments (in tar folder `data/alignments.tar.xz`) and the code to analyse the Carnivora dataset and produce the figures.

The file `Supermatrix_14463_genes_53_spp_UFBS_TESTNEW_Codon.tre` contains the full Carnivora species tree used in our analyses. 

The file `code.R` contains all the code to reproduce the analyses and the figures, except for the synteny analysis for which scripts and datasets are in folder `synteny`.
